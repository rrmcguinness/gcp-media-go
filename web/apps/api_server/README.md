# API Server

This is a simple server housing multiple functions

* /media?s= search
* /media/:id find media by id
* /media/:id/scenes/:scene_id find scenes

## Prior to running the server

Make sure you create a local config file in "//configs/.env.local.toml".
In that configuration add the following filling in your project name and api key

```toml
[application]
google_project_id=""
google_api_key=""

[big_query_data_sources."media_ds"]
dataset="media_ds"
table_names = ["media"]

[topic_subscriptions."HiResTopic"]
name="media_high_res_resources_subscription"
dead_letter_topic="media_high_res_events_dead_letter"
timeout_in_seconds=10
command_name=""

[topic_subscriptions."LowResTopic"]
name="media_low_res_resources_subscription"
dead_letter_topic="media_low_res_events_dead_letter"
timeout_in_seconds=10
command_name=""
```

## Running the server

```shell

# Start the server on port 8080
bazel run //web/apps/api_server

```

## Example output

```json
