# Test

The test directory contains all test cases for the media workflows, if you'd like to test manually,
and have a clean environment execute the following in order:

```shell
bazel build //...

# Reads the test media file
bazel test //test/workflow:media_ingestion

# Create the embeddings
bazel test //test/workflow:media_embeddings

# Run a test cast, find all scenes with Woody Harrelson AKA Carnage
bazel test //test/services/...

```

## Example Output

Here you should see the media file ID, and the scene sequence number.

```shell
0192aa4e-e375-7f26-aaec-ebe4fb4d803b - 25
0192aa4e-e375-7f26-aaec-ebe4fb4d803b - 13
0192aa4e-e375-7f26-aaec-ebe4fb4d803b - 12
